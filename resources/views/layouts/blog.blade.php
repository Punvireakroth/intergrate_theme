                <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere,
                    a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet,
                    in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men
                    occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice,
                    not in theory.</p>
                <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no
                    turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.

                <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they
                    set eye on the earth.</p>
